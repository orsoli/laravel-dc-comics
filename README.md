# Create a new Laravel 10 project to manage an archive of comics (or any type you prefer).

### Milestone 1
**Use the artisan commands to create a model with the corresponding migration and a resource controller.**

### Milestone 2
**Start defining the initial CRUD operations with the respective views:**
- `index()`
- `show()`
- `create()`
- `store()`

### Bonus:
**Create a seeder for the resource in use with the attached data (built independently, even with AI assistance for your resource).**
`comics.php`
